## Description

The **Password Strength Meter** is a user-friendly web app that analyzes passwords based on complexity, length, and common patterns. It provides a visual strength indicator (Weak, Medium, Strong) and suggestions for improving password security.

## Features
- ‚úÖ **Password Strength Analysis**: Checks password security based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- ‚úÖ **Instant Feedback**: Provides recommendations to improve weak passwords.
- ‚úÖ **Common Password Check**: Warns against using frequently used passwords.
- ‚úÖ **Strong Password Generator**: Generates secure passwords of user-defined length.
- ‚úÖ **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for a sleek and interactive UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core logic for password strength evaluation.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building and deploying the web app.
- **Regex**: For pattern matching and validation.
- **HTML/CSS**: Custom styling for a modern and responsive UI.
