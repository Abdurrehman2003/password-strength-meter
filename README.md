## Features
- ‚úÖ **Password Strength Analysis**: Checks password security based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- ‚úÖ **Instant Feedback**: Provides recommendations to improve weak passwords.
- ‚úÖ **Common Password Check**: Warns against using frequently used passwords.
- ‚úÖ **Strong Password Generator**: Generates secure passwords of user-defined length.
